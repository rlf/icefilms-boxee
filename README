The icefilms-boxee addon is a port of the icefilms-addon for XBMC to BOXEE.

The main reason for the need for a separate project is the way BOXEE is 
locked down, compared to XBMC.

The project is divided in two.

Part 1 - AddOn
==============
Contains the actual Boxee Box AddOn.

Part 2 - Scraper
================
Contains php-scripts that can be installed on any php-capable web-server which
provides simple RSS feeds based on the icefilms.info pages.
